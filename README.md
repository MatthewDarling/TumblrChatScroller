# TumblrChatScroller
A userscript for scrolling through Tumblr chat for backup purposes. If
it's the future and Tumblr has chat export, you don't need this!

# Tested configurations

So far, I've only tested with Firefox 61 and ViolentMonkey. Other
browsers or extensions may work perfectly fine, so please send
feedback if it works for you!

# Usage

1. Install a userscript manager like
[ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) or
[TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/)

2. Open [the script
   code](https://github.com/MatthewDarling/TumblrChatScroller/raw/master/tumblr-chat-scroller.user.js). You
   may be prompted to install right away, and if you are, do that! If
   you aren't, copy that URL and go to the userscript dashboard. There
   should be a button to add a script (maybe a '+'?), and underneath
   it, an option to "add from URL". Use that URL.

3. Go to the "Activity" page for your blog on Tumblr

4. Notice the "Scroll" button in the top toolbar? Click that!

# Updates

I've attempted to set up the script so that it will auto-update. I
don't know if it will actually work. If not, just redo the install
steps and that should overwrite the old version.
